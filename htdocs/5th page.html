                <h1>How to Check<br>If a Source<br>Is Credible</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li><h2>Check The Domain name</h2></li>
                    <p>The domain names of websites are the three letters at the end of websites like "edu" (educational), "gov" (government), and many more. A general rule of thumb is that ".gov" websites are the more credible source, though this is just a general rule as there are still sites that use these suffixes to mislead and misinform the readers.</p>
                    <p>Websites that end in .org are sometimes credible but tend to have biased articles where they may often use the information to promote their ideologies; for example, PETA(People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) will only provide sources that will support their cause.</p>
                    <o>Websites ending with .com and .edu are sometimes credible, too, and additional research on the source must be made to identify the credibility and authenticity of these websites' information.</o>
                    <li><h2>Identify the Intention of the Source</h2></li>
                    <p>For example, most sites are designed to inform readers of truthful and authentic facts, but some sites aim to spread false information and confuse their readers. Different sources have different reasons for their production. It is crucial to establish the basis for a source's writing as some are only for fear-mongering.</p>
                    <li><h2>Who is the Author?</h2></li>
                    <p>The source's author is also an essential factor to check since experts in the field best provide certain information; medical advice, for example, is only trustworthy when it comes from a medical professional and not blogs and posts on Facebook. It is also important to look at the author's background, as authors may have some background in plagiarizing or publishing false information.</p>
                    <li><h2>Who is the target audience of the source?</h2></li>
                    <p>The target audience for a source matters, and different target audiences of information may have certain biases and propaganda to please its audience. For example, pro-Duterte sources may be filled with sources that only put the president into good light and bends the truth, also how anti-Duterte sources may be filled with sources that only set the president into a bad light. Acknowledging all points of view into events is essential as there is always a gray area for everything, and false dichotomies like these are not reliable.</p>
                    <li><h2>When was the data published?</h2></li>
                    <p>As knowledge is always updated, the period a data has been released is essential and different information can be disproved and revised in the future. Using old sources is a common mistake committed by people. Old sources are typically no longer accurate, especially in an academic context where theories and terms are updated as science is continually improving.</p>
                </ol>
                <h2>Red Flags for Fake News</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Clickbait Headlines</p></li>
                    <li><p>Unusual URLs: usually websites that are ending with questionable URLs like .co, .123, etc.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Typos, Grammatical Errors: even reputable sources make mistakes but when a source is riddled with a bunch of typos is usually a red flag.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Lacks of Links and References</p></li>
